BuddyPress Multilingual allows BuddyPress and BuddyBoss sites to run fully multilingual using the WPML plugin.

== Description ==

The plugin allows building multilingual [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) and [BuddyBoss](https://www.buddyboss.com/) sites with [WPML](http://wpml.org/). It works with single-site or multi-site installations. Both the main site and child blogs can run multilingual.

Guest blogs can choose their language and create multilingual contents. Additionally, each guest can choose the admin language individually .

Requirements:

* WPML 4.5.x or higher. You must enable 'languages per directories' or 'languages per domain'.

= Features =

* Adds language switching to all BuddyPress/BuddyBoss pages (Activity, Groups, Profile and Register page)
* Allows to select the language when viewing user profiles
* Keeps the language consistent when clicking on different links (by adding the language to links)
* Allows to translate email notifications
* Keeps the entire BuddyPress/BuddyBoss workflow in the current language (create group, change avatars etc.)

= Need Support? =

Please submit support requests to **[WPML forum](http://wpml.org/forums/forum/english-support/)**. Remember to report:

* The versions of BuddyPress/BuddyBoss, WPML and WordPress that you're using.
* A URL to your site, where we can see the problem happening.
* A description of what you expect to see and what you're seeing in practice.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why cannot I use language as parameter? =

Support for language as parameter will not be added soon as we're looking for solutions other than filtering all kinds of navigation and action links.
